# Tool descriptions for the NBIS website

This repository contains descriptions of tools that are under
development or maintenance by NBIS staff. The tool descriptions are
presented on the NBIS website:
<http://www.nbis.se/infrastructure/tools/>.

All mature, released tools that are maintained by NBIS should have a
description in this repository. We also include descriptions for tools
that we are developing, but have not yet released, to show what we are
working on, both to colleagues within NBIS and externally.

## Directory structure

- `README.md`    This file
- `_scripts/`    Scripts to aid creation of tool descriptions
- `_stubs/`      Description "stubs" used when fetching information from bio.tools
- `_templates/`  Templates for tool descriptions
- `tools/`       Tool descriptions to be displayed on the website

Directories that should be ignored by the website content managment
system (Jekyll) are prefixed with underscore.

## Adding tool descriptions

The tool descriptions follow a simple YAML format. Please see the
files under the directory `tools` for examples, and check how they are
displayed at <http://www.nbis.se/infrastructure/tools/>. Each YAML file
corresponds to one tool. For descriptions of the attributes, see
`_templates/tool_template.yml`.

To add a file or make changes, first clone the
[nbis-site](https://github.com/NBISweden/nbis-site) repository as
described in its README. You will then find the tool description
repository (i.e. this repository) under the directory
`nbis_site/_biotools`, as a submodule. To see the effect of any
changes you make, follow the instructions in the nbis-site README file
to build and serve the NBIS web pages locally.

The procedure for adding tool descriptions depends on whether the tool
has been released.

### Adding unreleased tools

This is very easy. Just add a YAML file with information about the
tool, in the directory `tools` (i.e. `nbis_site/_biotools/tools`). You
can use the file `_templates/tool_template.yml` as a starting
point. That file also contains further recommendations and
explanations of the various attributes.

### Adding released tools

Tools that are released should preferably be added to the ELIXIR tools
registry [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) first. The aim with bio.tools
is to catalog *all* available bioinformatics tools. Since NBIS is part
of ELIXIR, we should aid this effort by making sure our tools are
included in bio.tools.

After you have registered the tool on bio.tools, the script
`_scripts/tool_validator.py` should be used to fetch information from
bio.tools and create a YAML file. Some information that is lacking
from bio.tools must be provided to the script in a JSON file. For a
hypothethical tool *myTool*, the steps would be:

1. Install the PyYAML library, which `tool_validator.py` depends
   on. This can be done by running `pip install PyYAML`, preferably in
   a virtual environment. The script also uses `urllib2`, which is a
   Python 2 module and the script will therefore not work with
   Python 3.
2. Create a file `_stubs/myTool.json`, using
   `_templates/tool_stub.json` as a template.
3. Execute: `python _scripts/tool_validator.py _stubs/myTool.json`
4. The above command should have created a file `myTool.yml`.
   Check that this newly created file looks OK.
5. Move the file into place: `mv myTool.yml tools`.

Steps 3-5 can be repeated to update a tool description if the
bio.tools record has been updated. We might automate this in the
future.

Fields in the JSON file:

- `pi` Name of PI in case ownership can be attributed to a research group. Optional.
- `affiliation` The affiliation of the PI or other organization behind the tool. For in-house tools, use `nbis.se`.
- `devstatus` Development status. Options are:
  - `Active` Tools under active development, i.e. new features are being added.
  - `Maintained` Tools that are mature and no longer actively developed, but maintained
    (e.g. bug fixes, updated for compatability with newer versions of dependencies).
  - `Inactive` Tools that we no longer work on. We probably shouldn't register such tools on bio.tools.
- `released` Should always be set to `true` for tools registered on bio.tools.
- `releasedate` When the tool was first released. Intended for sorting.
- `primary_doi` DOIs of publications describing the tool. Optional.
- `uses_doi` DOIs of publications where the tool was used. Not intended to be exahustive, but to provide a few examples.
  Please avoid redundancy with `primary_doi`. Optional.
- `biotools_version` Version of the tool on bio.tools. Does normally not have to be specified; the script
   will simply grab the latest version from bio.tools. Sometimes, however, this does not work, and the version needs to be provided.
- `biotools_id` ID of the tool on bio.tools.

### Publishing your changes on the NBIS web site

Run Jekyll locally (see above) and check the result of your changes at
<http://localhost:4000/infrastructure/tools/>.

To get your changes into the actual NBIS web site, you need to create
a working branch of toolsinfo, commit your changes to that branch,
push the branch to GitHub and make a pull request to be approved by
Mikael Borg. If you are a tool developer, you are most likely familiar
with this procedure.

## Further technical notes

If you wish to make any other changes to this repository, please note
that files that are to be ignored by Jekyll should be placed in a
directory prefixed with underscore. All YAML files that do not reside
in such excluded directories will be treated as tool descriptions and
displayed on the web site. All non-YAML files outside excluded
directories are copied to the website directory tree, unless
specifically excluded in the site config file `nbis_site/_config.yml`
(this README is excluded in that manner).
